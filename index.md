I'm Ganesh Pimpale

I am a student and aspiring researcher currently majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I have a wide variety of research projects ranging from image processing and its applications in compression and robotics to innovations and optimizations in additive manufacturing processes. As a student, I am always willing to try out different projects in new fields where I may not have any experience.
