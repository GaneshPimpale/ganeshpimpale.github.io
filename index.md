## Research
I have a wide variety of research projects ranging from image processing and its applications in compression and robotics to innovations and optimizations in additive manufacturing processes. As a student, I am always willing to try out different projects in new fields where I may not have any experience.

Please check out the **[portfolio](portfolio)** section of my website to read more about my research and other projects.
