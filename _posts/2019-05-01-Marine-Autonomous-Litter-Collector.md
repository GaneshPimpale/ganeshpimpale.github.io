# Abstract
The oceans hold 322 million tonnes of garbage. Millions of sea creatures die each year due to consumption of plastics and entanglement in plastic waste. We aim to aid the removal of plastic pollution from our oceans by building an autonomous device that will collect waste and bring it to a base station for processing. Our criteria is to have an autonomous and manually driven vehicle that can carry 5 kilograms of trash and run for 10 minutes. These are the basic needs to have a device capable of picking up trash. 

We tested our boat in a pool so that we could have a controlled environment where we could test the speed of the boat and how well it could collect trash. The trash that we collected with the boat was multiple 2 litre soda bottles, water bottles, and plastic bags, as we found that these are extremely common forms of waste in the ocean. Through many trials of testing the GPS over certain lengths we determined that our GPS was approximately 93% accurate. We measured the average speed of our boat to be approximately 0.1m/s. We determined this by driving the boat for a distance of 3.5 metres while we recorded the time. From distance and time, we calculated speed. 

Our GPS was adequately accurate, although this was in a limited testing environment. Our results would have been more representative of real-world use had we been able to test over a larger distance. The speed of our boat was disappointing, however we know many points of failure that we would enhance in a future iteration of this project. The main loss of energy in our system was the extremely inefficient propellers which did not properly convert rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy because they were not able to exert much force against the water. In a future version, we could use premade propellers instead of making our own, or we could more deeply research effective propellers in order to make better ones of our own. Our other main point of failure was our underpowered motors which simply could not produce enough speed and torque to move our boat. 

With all the trash currently in the oceans and the lack of other solutions, our project has the potential to be used to help clean large bodies of water. There are many other features that can be improved or redesigned to maximise the efficiency of our boat. In order for our design to make a lasting impact upon the marine environment many modifications could be made to streamline and optimise M.A.L.C. a) A more compact and efficient way to store and dispose of collected pollutants, b) An efficient system for turning the garbage dump, c) The effectiveness of M.A.L.C in polluted waters for a real-life representation.
