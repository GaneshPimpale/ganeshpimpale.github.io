# Abstract
Robotic dexterity and adaptivity are extensively valued in industrial settings such as manufacturing companies or assembly lines due to their propensity to reduce latency and also the requirement for human involvement. Consequently, these attributes are often modeled after the human hand, which is considered to be one of the most versatile mechanisms concerning object manipulation given its powerful grip and its ability to manipulate small objects with great precision. Although that hardware with the potential to mimic the human hand does exist, there are few options for intelligent software that can autonomously handle objects in conjunction with this hardware. As a step towards producing this software, we created a pure object identification algorithm to discern the optimal means of holding a complex object. The algorithm proceeds by deconstructing complex objects into pure shapes of different parameters, which are then manipulated to determine the grasp that imposes the least amount of movement from the handâ€™s initial position and the least amount of pressure applied to the hand and object. As a matter of course, this program is also able to validate the grasp and, upon confirmation, undergo a test process involving the optimal grasp and pure object.
