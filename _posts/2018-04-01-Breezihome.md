# Introduction
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 21% of all household energy usage in 2017 was directed towards space heating and cooling, for a stunning total of 298 billion kWh used in the United States alone. Additionally, the EPA’s website states that approximately 1640 lbs of CO₂ are emitted per mWh. Therefore, nearly 500 billion lbs of CO₂ are emitted into the atmosphere each year from space heating and cooling alone. 

Theenergy spent on space heating and cooling can easily be reduced with a simple energy-efficient way of heating and cooling - using windows. In hotter months, windows can be opened at night to cool down the house. In colder months, windows can be opened when the sun is out and hot to warm the house. This way, air conditioners need only be used for shorter periods of time. 
However, the major constraint with using windows to regulate temperature is that windows have to be manually opened and closed at the optimal time to ensure that they properly cool down or heat up the house. Most importantly, many people are unable to open/close their windows at those times because they will be out at work during the day. Even during the night, people usually keep them open the whole night because they are sleeping. 

Our clients need a system that will ensure that windows are opened/closed at the correct time based on the inside and outside temperatures. This will be automated but can be remotely controlled by our clients. It must also be connected to the A/C and heater to ensure that windows are not opened while the A/C or heater is running. Lastly, our product needs to be secure. If there is a remote way to open the windows, only the user should be able to open them, so that thieves cannot take advantage of the system.
