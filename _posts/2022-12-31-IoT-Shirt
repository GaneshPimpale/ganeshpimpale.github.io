# Abstract
The majority of devices designed to measure pulmonary data, specifically lung volume, are invasive; attaching to the mouth and/or nose making them difficult to wear for long periods of time. This paper goes over our design, development, and performance of a noninvasive, IoT-enabled pulmonary data measurement device. Our device uses a system of capacitive sensors to measure the expansion of the chest which is simple in terms of its mechanical design but requires a detailed calibration process.
