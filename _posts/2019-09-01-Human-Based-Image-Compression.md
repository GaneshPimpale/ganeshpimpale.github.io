# Abstract
In 2018, Prof. ​Tsachy Weissman’s lab conducted research on using human semantics to compress an image. A ‘describer’ would provide links to image assets representing elements of the original image ​[1]​; for example, given a picture of the savanna, the describer would provide images of grass and trees, among others. With the provided compiled components, the describer would use natural language to describe how a ‘reconstructor’ could combine the elements to create an image semantically similar to the original. The instructions and links constituted the compressed image. They called this approach Humans as Awesome Compressors (HAAC). While this compression scheme significantly reduced the size of an image, the natural language instructions were imprecise and could be shortened further. To solve this a scripting-based image editing software that tracks the actions of the describer and can execute them on the reconstructor side, thus improving precision. ​Future research could involve completely automated image compression through the use of artificial intelligence, and the implementation of compression using a neural network and creating a database of pre-segmented images. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/GaneshPimpale/AI-Compression).
