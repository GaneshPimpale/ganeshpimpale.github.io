# Abstract
AutoVideoEdit (AVE) is a Python package designed to automate particularly tedious tasks involved with video editing. Specifically, this paper will focus on the development and performance of the video clip search by visual description feature. AVE allows users to easily load their videos and splice a series of queries together into a final edit within ten lines of code. We present an overview of AVEâ€™s internal design, performance, strengths, limitations, and future developments. Code can be found [https://github.com/GaneshPimpale/AutoVideoEdit](here).
